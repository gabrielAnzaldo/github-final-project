# Simple Interest Calculator

A shell script that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

## Description
This project contains a Bash script (`simple-interest.sh`) designed to automate the calculation of simple interest. It is a tool useful for students, financial analysts, or anyone needing a quick way to determine interest on a loan or investment without manual calculation.

## Formula
The script uses the standard mathematical formula for calculating simple interest:

> **$SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$**

Where:
* **P** = Principal amount
* **R** = Annual rate of interest
* **T** = Time period in years

## Input Requirements
The script prompts the user to enter the following values:
1.  **Principal:** The initial amount of money (e.g., 1000).
2.  **Annual Interest Rate:** The percentage rate (e.g., 5 for 5%).
3.  **Time Period:** The duration in years (e.g., 2).

## Usage Instructions
