All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug in the shell script, please create a new issue in the GitHub repository. Provide a clear description of the problem and the steps to reproduce it.

### Suggesting Enhancements
We are always looking for ways to make the calculator better. If you have an idea for a new feature—such as support for compound interest or a more advanced UI—feel free to open an issue to discuss it.

### Pull Request Process
1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the project to your local machine.

5. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
6. Open a **Pull Request** and describe the changes you have made.

## Style Guidelines
* Ensure the shell script remains compatible with standard Bash.
* Update the `README.md` if your changes introduce new input fields or functionality.
